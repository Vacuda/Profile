        <h1>Unity Engine Experience</h1>

        <p>This unfinished project, named 
            <a href="/honey_hives">Honey Hives</a>
            , was part of a two-week sprint to learn Unity by building a quick prototype. I definitely used my building experience with Unreal to move quickly into how Unity was looking for you to build a project. I can see how Unity is quicker to get things on screen, but I did have to turn my back on trying to make things as lean as possible.</p>
