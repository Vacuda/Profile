        <h1>Jigsaw Registry</h1>

        <p>A big hobby of mine is doing jigsaw puzzles.  At one point, I went looking for an app that could help me log my puzzling hobby, but I didn't find it.  So, I built it myself!</p>
        <p>I have not yet been back to it to make it look and feel nice, but it was a challenge working with so many different models and forms.</p>
        
        <h4>Technologies</h4>
        <p>Python, Django, SQLite</p>
