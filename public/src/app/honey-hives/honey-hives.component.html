        <h1>Honey Hives</h1>

        
        <p>This game is the result of a two-week sprint I did to learn Unity. (really, 16 days) I quickly designed the game on paper using cut out hexagons.  I had to struggle with learning how Unity wanted you to build a game, but I was helped a lot by my experience with Unreal.</p>
        <p>It's a kind of Hexagon Sodoku using tiles that you can maybe spin or maybe move between various honeycombs.  Brighten each flower to complete a honeycomb.</p>
