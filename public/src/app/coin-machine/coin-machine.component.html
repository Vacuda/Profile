    <h1>Coin Machine API</h1>

    <p>I learned Ruby on Rails for this assignment from a prospective employer.  It's a basic CRUD API for depositing and withdrawing different coins from a machine.  It manages the possible coins and all of the transactions.  It alerts admins when the coin levels are too low.  It also uses a rudamentary, non-secure api key check before performing an action.</p>
    <h4>Technologies</h4>
    <p>Ruby on Rails, JSON, SQLite, Postman</p>
